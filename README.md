This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run Project
You can either open two terminal windows to run the API and the web app, or run the API in the background & web app in the foreground as shown below:
```
uvicorn api.main:app --reload &
npm start
```

If you open two windows, run these in separate windows:

`uvicorn api.main:app --reload &`

`npm start`
